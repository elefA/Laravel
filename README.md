# Laravel
Sample Project that represents a clone of Instagram created by following the tutorial on youtube by freeCodeCamp.org

Node Modules folder was deleted because it took up a lot of space to upload it to Git.

To run the project transfer all files in a directory.

Follow the instructions on Laravel Homepage to set up Laravel, composer etc.

To install Node Modules again run 'npm install' inside the directory of the project from the cmd.

Afterwards the project can be viewed normally by executing the 'php artisan serve' command in the cmd and then connecting to http://127.0.0.1:8000/ which represents the IP address of the local host 'server'
